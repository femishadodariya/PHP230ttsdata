                         Interface access property by its another class using implement

Q-4:-What Is Overloading?
=> Overloaded functions enable you to supply different semantics for a function, depending on the types and number of its arguments.





Q-5:-What Is T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM (Scope Resolution Operator (::) with  Example
=> (::) it is static method .
=> it used to access property of class without creating object.

Example:-
Class A
{
            Public static function name()
         {
                  echo  “my name is femish”;
         }
}
A::name();




Q-6:-What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces?
=> An abstract class contains an abstract keyword on the declaration whereas an Interface is a sketch that is used to implement a class.



Q-7:-Define Constructor and Destructor?
=> constructor:- A constructor allows an object to initialize some of its value before it is used. 
=> Destructor:- A destructor allows an object to execute some code at the time of its destruction.



Q-8:-How to Load Classes in PHP?

Q-11:-What Happen, If Constructor Is Defined As Private Or Protected?
=> private constructor:- When a constructor is defined as private, it can only be called from within the class itself. Instances of the class cannot be created from outside the class using the “new” keyword.
=> protected constructor:- When a constructor is defined as protected, it can be called from within the class and its subclasses. Instances of the class cannot be created from outside the class hierarchy using the “new” keyword.





Q-12:-What are PHP Magic Methods/Functions? List them Write program for Static
Keyword in PHP?
__construct()
__destruct()
__call($fun, $arg)
__callStatic($fun, $arg)
__get($property)
__set($property, $value)
__isset($content)
__unset($content)
__sleep()
__wakeup()
__toString()
__invoke()
__set_state($array)
__clone()
__debugInfo()








Q-13:-Create multiple Traits and use it in to a single class?
=> trait A
{
      Public function A()
     {

            echo “my name is femish”;
       }
}
$obj=new A;
$obj->name();

Use:-
Class A
{
Public $name=”femish”;
Publict function n()
{
echo $this->name;

$obj= new A;
$obj->n();
